        Hey there! I'm Ben, a 24-year-old career changer who has hung up his
        corporate shoes in search of a new challenge. After five years in sales,
        it was time to shake things up. Taking some time to work as a gardener
        and recalibrating my goals, I was persuaded by a close friend to dip my
        toes into the world of software development, which captivated my
        interest. So here I am, enthusiastic and eager to continue growing as a
        Full Stack Web Developer.
        <br />
        <br /> Starting in February 2024, I have undertaken a three-month
        internship at Datacom, Auckland, alongside several other candidates from
        Mission Ready as part of my Certificate in Applied Technology Product
        Solutions. My team has been tasked with developing an enterprise web
        application which we hope to release for production in April 2024.
        <br />
        <br /> This website is still under construction, but is soon to be a
        showcase of my work, which i'm very excited to share with you shortly.
        If you have any questions or would like to get in touch, please feel
        free to contact me. You'll find my contact info and upcoming projects
        below. See you soon!
